# React

## React v18 basic setup:

```js
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    </div>
  );
}

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
root.render(<App />);
```

> With previous versions of react:

```js
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    </div>
  );
}

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById("root"));
```

- When a component is removed from the view, this is called unmounting.
- When state or props change, the component is re-rendered (this means the component is removed and replaced with the component function using updated state or props).
- state is updated using an event handler or a callback function.
- React is called react because it reacts to state changes by re-rendering the UI.

- In the following code we would expect the incrementStep function to update the state twice...

```js
const incrementStep = () => {
  setStep(step === 3 ? 1 : step + 1);
  setStep(step === 3 ? 1 : step + 1);
};
```

- In reality it only updates once.
- We should not rely on the previous state when updating state.
- If we want to update state based on previous state we should provide a callback function to the setter function.

```js
const incrementStep = () => {
  setStep((prevStep) => (prevStep === 3 ? 1 : prevStep + 1));
  setStep((prevStep) => (prevStep === 3 ? 1 : prevStep + 1));
};
```

> Each instance of a component has and manages it's own state.

## Guidlines for using state:

- Use a state variable for any data the component should keep track of over time. (like a `let` or `var` variable or a `const` array or object that you mutate over time).

- For data that should not trigger a component re-render use a regular variable instead or use a ref.

---

### Controled Elements:

- by default, input elements like `<input>` and `<select>` maintain their own state in the DOM.
- In React development we like to keep track of state internally in our app... not in the DOM.
- In order to do that we use a technique called controlled elements...

> Example of a controlled element:

```js
function Form() {
  const [description, setDescription] = useState("");
  function handleSubmit(event) {
    event.preventDefault();
  }
  return (
    <form className="add-form" onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <h3>What do you need for your trip?üß≥</h3>
      <select>
        {Array.from({ length: 20 }, (_, index) => (
          <option key={index + 1} value={index + 1}>
            {index + 1}
          </option>
        ))}
      </select>
      <input type="text" name="item" placeholder="Item..." value={description} onChange={(event) => setDescription(event.target.value)} />
      <button>Add</button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

- In the above example, the input element is a controlled element because it's value is controlled by the state variable `description`, and the state variable is updated by the `onChange` event handler.

---

### Difference between props and state:

- State is interal to the component and props are passed in from the parent component.
- State can be changed by the component itself, props cannot be changed by the component itself.
- Props are passed in as attributes to the component.
- When the child compponent recieves new props from the parent component, the child component is re-rendered.

---

### Lifting State Up:

#### Instructions for lifting up state...

1. Identify the common state: Determine which component(s) need access to the shared state. Look for any data that needs to be shared or updated across these components.

2. Find the closest common ancestor: Identify the closest common ancestor of the components that need access to the shared state. This ancestor component will be responsible for managing and updating the state.

3. Define the state in the ancestor component: Add the necessary state variables to the ancestor component. These state variables will hold the shared data.

4. Pass the state as props: Pass the state variables as props from the ancestor component to the child components that need access to the shared state. This way, the child components can read the state and render accordingly.

5. Update the state: If any component needs to update the shared state, define a function in the ancestor component that modifies the state. Pass this function as a prop to the child components that need to update the shared state.

6. Handle state updates: In the child components, use the passed down function prop to update the state. Call this function whenever the component needs to modify the shared state.

#### Before lifting item state up from Form component:

```js
import { useState } from "react";

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="app">
      <Logo />
      <Form />
      <PackingList />
      <Stats />
    </div>
  );
}

function Form() {
  const [description, setDescription] = useState("");
  const [quantity, setQuantity] = useState(1);
  const [items, setItems] = useState([]);
  function handleAddItems(item) {
    setItems((prevItems) => [...prevItems, item]);
  }
  function handleSubmit(event) {
    event.preventDefault();
    //guard clause against empty description
    if (!description) return;
    const newItem = { description, quantity, packed: false, id: Date.now() };
    console.log(newItem);
    handleAddItems(newItem);
    //reset the form
    setDescription("");
    setQuantity(1);
  }
  return (
    <form className="add-form" onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <h3>What do you need for your trip?üß≥</h3>
      <select value={quantity} onChange={(event) => setQuantity(Number(event.target.value))}>
        {Array.from({ length: 20 }, (_, index) => (
          <option key={index + 1} value={index + 1}>
            {index + 1}
          </option>
        ))}
      </select>
      <input type="text" name="item" placeholder="Item..." value={description} onChange={(event) => setDescription(event.target.value)} />
      <button>Add</button>
    </form>
  );
}
const Item = ({ item }) => {
  return (
    <li key={item.id}>
      <span style={item.packed ? { textDecoration: "line-through" } : {}}>
        {item.description} {item.quantity}
      </span>
      <button>‚ùå</button>
    </li>
  );
};
function PackingList() {
  return (
    <div className="list">
      {" "}
      <ul>
        {initialItems.map((item) => {
          return <Item key={item.id} item={item} />;
        })}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### After lifting item state up from Form component:

```js
import { useState } from "react";

function App() {
  const [items, setItems] = useState([]);
  function handleAddItems(item) {
    setItems((prevItems) => [...prevItems, item]);
  }
  return (
    <div className="app">
      <Logo />
      <Form onAddItem={handleAddItems} />
      <PackingList items={items} />
      <Stats />
    </div>
  );
}

function Form({ onAddItem }) {
  const [description, setDescription] = useState("");
  const [quantity, setQuantity] = useState(1);

  function handleSubmit(event) {
    event.preventDefault();
    //guard clause against empty description
    if (!description) return;
    const newItem = { description, quantity, packed: false, id: Date.now() };
    console.log(newItem);
    onAddItem(newItem);
    //reset the form
    setDescription("");
    setQuantity(1);
  }
  return (
    <form className="add-form" onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <h3>What do you need for your trip?üß≥</h3>
      <select value={quantity} onChange={(event) => setQuantity(Number(event.target.value))}>
        {Array.from({ length: 20 }, (_, index) => (
          <option key={index + 1} value={index + 1}>
            {index + 1}
          </option>
        ))}
      </select>
      <input type="text" name="item" placeholder="Item..." value={description} onChange={(event) => setDescription(event.target.value)} />
      <button>Add</button>
    </form>
  );
}
const Item = ({ item }) => {
  const description = item.quantity > 1 ? `${item.description}s` : item.description;

  return (
    <li key={item.id}>
      <span style={item.packed ? { textDecoration: "line-through" } : {}}>
        {item.quantity} {description}
      </span>
      <button>‚ùå</button>
    </li>
  );
};

function PackingList({ items }) {
  return (
    <div className="list">
      {" "}
      <ul>
        {items.map((item) => {
          return <Item key={item.id} item={item} />;
        })}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Derived State:

- Derived state is state that is calculated from other state or props.
- If state can be derived from existing state then we do not want to create a new state to represent it because this will result in unnecessary rerendering any time the related state changes.

### Props.children:

- An empty hole that can be filled with any jsx the component recieves as children. The children prop allows us to pass jsx into an element. The only difference is that the children prop is not an html attribute but rather a prop that allows us to access jsx that is passed into the component as children.

```js
function Button(props) {
  const { clickHandler, backgroundColor, textColor } = props;
  return (
    <button
      style={{ backgroundColor: backgroundColor, color: textColor }}
      onClick={clickHandler}
    >
      {props.children}
    </button>
  );
}

export default Button;

// App.js
<Button
clickHandler={decrementStep}
backgroundColor="#7950f2"
textColor="#fff"
>
<span>‚èÆÔ∏è</span> Previous
</Button>

<Button
clickHandler={incrementStep}
backgroundColor="#7950f2"
textColor="#fff"
emoji="‚è≠Ô∏è"
>
{" "}
Next<span>‚è≠Ô∏è</span>
</Button>
```

#### Reusability:

** General Guidlines**

- Creating new components creates mental abstractions that are hard to keep track of in your mind.
- Name components according to what it does or what it displays... don't be afraid to use long component names.
- NEVER declare a new component inside of another component.
- Colocate related components inside the same file. Don't seperate components into different files too early in development.

---

## How React Works:

- A component is a function that describes of a part of the UI.
- A component is a function that returns React elements (jsx).
- A component is a generic blueprint or template for which different data will produce different UI.
- Instances are created when we use components in our code.

```js
function Tabbed({ content }) {
  const [activeTab, setActiveTab] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <div className="tabs">
        <Tab num={0} activeTab={activeTab} onClick={setActiveTab} />
        <Tab num={1} activeTab={activeTab} onClick={setActiveTab} />
        <Tab num={2} activeTab={activeTab} onClick={setActiveTab} />
        <Tab num={3} activeTab={activeTab} onClick={setActiveTab} />
      </div>

      {activeTab <= 2 ? <TabContent item={content.at(activeTab)} /> : <DifferentContent />}
    </div>
  );
}

function Tab({ num, activeTab, onClick }) {
  return (
    <button className={activeTab === num ? "tab active" : "tab"} onClick={() => onClick(num)}>
      Tab {num + 1}
    </button>
  );
}
```

> In the above example, the Tabbed component returns multiple instances of the Tab component.

_An instance is the actual manifestation of a component that has it's own state and props (and has a lifecycle... i.e. it can be mounted and unmounted)._

- A component instance returns a React element (jsx) The react element is the result of the component function call.

> Component instance: `console.log(<DifferentContent test={23}/>);` --> type: DifferentContent
> React element: `console.log(DifferentContent({test: 23}));` --> type: div

- Finally the react element is rendered to the DOM using the ReactDOM.render() function(html)

**How React Renders Components:**

1. Render is triggered (By updating state somewhere)
2. React calls the component functions and figures out how the Dom should be updated (Render phase). DOM is not actually updated in this phase.
   > In React, rendering is not updating the DOM or displaying elements on the screen. Rendering is the process of figuring out what changes need to be made to the DOM.
3. Commit Phase: React updates the DOM with the changes that were determined in the render phase.
4. Browser paints the screen... (produces visual changes user sees on their screen.)

**Two situations that trigger renders:**

1. Initial render: When the component is first mounted to the DOM.
2. When state or props change: When state or props change, the component is re-rendered.

- A render is not triggered immediatly but scheduled for when the JS engine has some 'free time' . there is also batching of multiple setState calls in event handlers.

Two common misconceptions about React:

1. **(false)** _Rendering is updating the screen/DOM_
2. **(false)** _React completely discards old view(DOM) on Re-Renders_

**Virtual DOM (React Element Tree):**

1. **Initial Render** (Component Tree) gets converted to a React Element Tree (Virtual DOM) by React. This tree of react elements is what we refer to as the virtual dom. In practice this is a tree of all react elements freated from all instances in the component tree. It is cheap and fast to create multiple trees because behind the scenes they are JS-objects not DOM elements.

- In react documentation the term `virtual dom` has been replaced with `react element tree` , but it is still a common term in the community. (**Nothing to do with Shadow Dom.. which is a browser concept that has to do with isolating a branch of the DOM from the rest of the DOM**)

**Rendering a component will cause all of it's child comonents to be rerendered as well (even if props has not changed)**

> This is done because React doesn't know if children will be affected by the parent's render. So it just rerenders all children to be safe... remember that rendering is cheap and fast in React.

2. **Rerender Phase**
   Component instaces that triger re-render ---> React Element Tree (virtual dom) ---> Reconcilation + Diffing (Reconciliation is done by React's Reconciler known as Fiber) ---> Updated Fiber Tree (used to write to the DOM).

- What is Reconciliation and why do we need it?
  > Writing to the DOM is relativly slow and usually only a small part of the DOM needs to be updated. Whenever a re-render is triggered, React will try to reuse as much of the existing DOM as possible.

> **Reconciliation** is the process of deciding which DOM elements actually need to be inserted, deleted, or updated in order to reflect the latest changes in state.
> The result of reconiliation is a list of DOM operations that need to be performed in order to update the DOM.

- The reconciler (fiber) will create a new fiber tree from the the React Element Tree (Virtual DOM) and has a fiber for each component instance and DOM element... Fibers are not recreated on every rerender. The fiber tree is mutated on each rerender rather than recreated. Fiber keeps track of current state, props, sideEffects and used Hooks (as well as a _queue of work_ to be done) for each component instance.

- A fiber is a unit of work to be done... stored as a linked list for each component instance. The fiber tree is a tree of linked lists. The work can be done asynchronously and paused, resumed, or aborted. In react 18 this enables concurrent features like suspense or transitions. This means long renders won't block the JS engine.

**Reconciliation:**

- Take the virtual dom and the corresponding fiber tree... let's say a piece of state (that determines of a modal is shown or not) is flipped from true to false... this will cause a new virtual dom where the modal component is removed. All remaning elements were re-rendered. This new React Element Tree(virtual DOM) needs to be reconciled with the existing fiber tree. This will result in an updated fiber tree (work in progress tree).

![Reconciliation](./images/2023-08-25-11-45-39.png)

![Component Tree](./images/2023-08-25-12-00-26.png)

- -> In the example in the image above the Btn element (yellow) has different text depending on the state in question and so the work to be done in the fiber tree is to update the DOM with the new text.

- -> The Modal, Overlay, H3, and Button (red) are no longer in the React Element Tree and are thus marked for deletion in the Updated Fiber tree.

- -> Finally we have the Video component which is a child of the App component but it did not change between renders and thus after reconciliation the dom element for the video will not be updated.

- -> Once reconciliation takes place all the dom mutations will be placed into a list called the _list of effects_ which will be used in the next (Commit) phase to update the DOM.
